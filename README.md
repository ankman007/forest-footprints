## Project Description

Our Project “Forest Footprints” is a prototype that addresses deforestation in Nepal through technology and community action. Using satellite data and AI-generated insights, it helps communities understand deforestation impacts and encourages local conservation efforts. Though currently without live map layers, the platform's core focus is raising awareness and empowering collective action for forest preservation.
